# PolChain

**Track:** Digital Empowerment

**Challenge Statement:** [hackwarsaw] Develop a solution that utilizes an Avalanche Subnet to help Warsaw residents of all ages and backgrounds become more comfortable using blockchain technology in everyday life.

## Project Overview

PolChain is a decentralized application (dApp) designed for a blockchain-based ticketing platform on an Avalanche subnet. It ensures 100% authentic digital tickets as NFTs, which are transacted and stored securely. The platform is designed to cater to the exchange and validation of digital goods with features such as insurance, royalties, and fraud prevention. PolChain aims to expand to other digital goods like hotel bookings and memberships, ensuring authenticity and security for all transactions.

## Features

- **Authentic Digital Tickets**: All tickets are issued as NFTs, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud.
- **Security**: Transactions are securely processed and stored on the Avalanche subnet.
- **Insurance**: Provides insurance for digital goods transactions.
- **Royalties**: Supports royalty mechanisms for ticket resales.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Advanced mechanisms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced user interface for better user experience.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: Converted from TRC20 to ERC20 for Avalanche compatibility.
